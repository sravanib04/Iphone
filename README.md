# Iphone
# What it is
This is an iPhone built using JavaScript drawings.

# How I built it
My group and I measured the coordinates and then drew an iPhone and apps in it using JavaScript App Lab.

# What I learned
I realized the importance of collaboration, functions, and things JavaScript can do. My group and I could divide up the work and work on their apps and then put together the final product. Without functions, I would have had to repeat lots of code which would not have been efficient. I also realized that I could use app lab to draw and create various things.
